# AI Text Detection

A Python implementation for detecting AI-generated text using various statistical and machine learning approaches. This project is based on the [Mercor AI Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mercor-ai-detection/overview) on Kaggle, which aims to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text.

## Dataset
The project uses the Mercor AI Detection Challenge dataset from Kaggle, which contains:
- Training data with labeled text samples (human-written vs AI-generated)
- Test data for model evaluation
- Real-world examples of both human and AI-generated content

## Overview
- `tf-idf.ipynb`: Implementation of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method
- `tf-idf-vol2.ipynb`: Enhanced TF-IDF implementation with additional features

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to:
- Analyze text patterns and features
- Calculate statistical measures of text
- Detect AI-generated content

## Usage
Open the Jupyter notebooks to see the implementation and examples.

```bash
jupyter notebook tf-idf.ipynb
```
